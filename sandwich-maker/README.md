# Sandwich Maker Machine

## Overview
The Sandwich Maker Machine is a Python-based program designed to simulate a simple sandwich ordering system. This project demonstrates modular programming, object-oriented design, and basic resource management. It was created as part of a class assignment to practice breaking a program into multiple files with clear responsibilities.

## Features
- Allows users to order different sandwich sizes
- Tracks ingredient usage and availability
- Calculates the cost of each sandwich
- Uses separate modules for data, machine logic, cashier logic, and program execution

## Project Structure
- `main.py`  
  Entry point of the program. Handles program flow and user interaction.

- `sandwich_maker.py`  
  Contains the `SandwichMaker` class, which manages sandwich creation and ingredient resources.

- `cashier.py`  
  Contains the `Cashier` class, responsible for handling payment and cost calculations.

- `data.py`  
  Stores sandwich recipes, ingredient requirements, and pricing data.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Modular Design
